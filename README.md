# resumeGPT


ResumeGPT is an LLM trained on my personal career profile including my resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn profile. It is designed to assess my suitability for various job roles based on a job description and my skills. It can also customize responses to job board questions according to my skills and experience.

Furthermore, ResumeGPT is expected to evolve into a Chrome extension with the following capabilities:

1. **Job Matching**: Find jobs that align with my skills and experience.
2. **AutoFill Feature**: Automatically fill job application forms with my accurate details.
3. **Tailored Responses**: Customize responses to career-related questions based on my skills and experience.

**Note**: ResumeGPT is currently in its experimental stage and operates using Streamlit.
